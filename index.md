# The Red Rock Ridge and Valley Trail System
* The Red Rock Trail System is currently a network of 125 miles of trails, parks, bikes, and sidewalks. Moreover, the system currently obtains a 750-mile plan that proposes a connection between the seven available corridors, which will provide a complete access to routine transportation and recreation within the Jefferson County Area.

# Project Goals

* The main goal for this project is to build a mobile app that is personalized to the needs of the Red Rock Trail System.

* We aim to provide an app that facilitates access to information that benefits the users by encouraging people to be active, help with the navigation of the trails, and promote nature conservation. Moreover, with a personalized app for the Jefferson County Area, users will have access to events and volunteering opportunity that will advance the 750-mile plan proposal. 

* Create user profiles that will help in the development of a better sense of community by allowing users to participate in activities. 

* Gamify the user profiles by tracking miles walked/ran/biked and provide badges for achievements.
